# Overview 
The Console-based Tourist Information System is designed to provide detailed information about tourist attractions in various cities. The system includes features such as viewing attraction details, navigating by city and attraction type, checking flight connectivity, and allowing the administrator to manage data effectively.

# System Speicification 
## Attraction Information:
Cities have various attractions classified into different types.
Tourists can view detailed information about attractions by choosing a city, attraction type, and the specific attraction itself.

## City and Attraction Navigation:
Tourists can choose a city from an alphabetical list.
They can then choose from a list of attractions in the selected city, either with or without specifying an attraction type.

## Dynamic Attraction Count:
The system doesn't have a fixed maximum number of attractions per city, allowing for flexibility and scalability.

## User-Friendly Interface:
Design a console-based user interface for easy navigation and interaction with the system.

## Flight Connectivity:
Extend the system to include information about cities connected by direct flights.
Provide an interface for users to check whether City A and City B are connected by flights, either directly or indirectly.

## Administrator Functions:
Only the system administrator has the authority to add, remove, or modify data.
The administrator can save entered data into a text file and load data from a text file.

## Data Modification:
The data the administrator can manage includes city information, attraction details, attraction types, and flight connectivity.
